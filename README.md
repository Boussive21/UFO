# UFO
#Overview
For this project we created an HTML page that focuses on UFO spotting. Using JavaScript to create a data file to filter the data from a data.js file. This data file focuses on where the date the UFO was spotted, the shapes, area, and comments 

#Results for HTML
Once we create the HTML page the viewer of the page is greeted with “The Truth is Out There” jumbotron font.  As the user scrolls down, they see the data that was scraped from the data file and shows all the data and by inputting data into the page it filters the specific outcome. Typing in a data type into the search bar we can filter our multiple types of data and can specify which event the user wants to see.  
#Summary
The page was created relatively clean apart from the banner the data was clean. Unfortunately, I was unable to import the NASA.jpeg to be the banner for web page so looking at the title is a little difficult right now. And able to filter the dataset and filter multiple data types and can search for specific events. Like the mars projects if their images associated I would like to pull up images and show them when the data type is pulled up. Another thing that would be nice to have in this set would be another type of set that verifies the claim of the UFO sighting with a True or False option.
